        The Importance of the NIF When Signing a Rental Contract
      </h2>
      <div class="about-content-text">
        <p>
          For a rental contract to be unequivocally valid under Portuguese law,
          it must be registered with the “Finanças” — the Portuguese Tax and
          Customs Authority (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira). For this
          reason, it’s very important to obtain your Portuguese NIF (tax
          identification number). You can even do this before you start looking
          for accommodation or before arriving in Portugal.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Update the content section -->
      <div class="article-body">
        <div class="article-date">02 June 2025</div>
        <img
          src="assets/images/articles/nif-importance.jpeg"
          alt="Article content image"
          class="article-content-image"
        />

        <p>
          Having the NIF of both parties included in the contract, and ensuring
          the contract is formalized and registered with the Portuguese Tax
          Authority (“Finanças”), offers protection against illegal practices —
          such as informal, verbal, or off-the-record agreements — which provide
          no legal security.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the NIF allows the tenant to access tax benefits, such as
          deducting rental expenses on their IRS (Personal Income Tax), as long
          as the contract is properly registered and includes their NIF. This
          registration promotes transparency and helps prevent fraud, protecting
          the tenant from potential abuses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important point is that the NIF is an official form of
          identification, ensuring that the contract is linked to the correct
          person, avoiding confusion or future disputes regarding the person
          named in the contract. In case any issues arise — such as the need to
          file a complaint or resolve a conflict — the NIF simplifies the
          process with judicial or administrative authorities.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How can I check if the landlord registered the rental contract with
          “Finanças” using my NIF?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The tenant can request proof of registration from the landlord, such
          as a copy of the Modelo 2 rental declaration submitted to “Finanças.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the tenant can check this information directly on the
          “Portal das Finanças,” where it is possible to verify whether the
          contract has been properly reported and linked to their tax
          identification number. Additionally, the presence of electronic rent
          receipts on “e-Fatura” also indicates that the landlord is complying
          with tax obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equally important is to mention that issuing rent payment receipts is
          generally a legal requirement. This official document from “Finanças”
          must be provided to the tenant by the landlord after each monthly rent
          payment, but it is only issued if the contract is properly declared.
          You can learn more about rent receipts below.
        </p>
        <div style="height: 2rem"></div>
        <h3>Why Rent Receipts Are Important for Tenants?</h3>
        <p>
          Rent receipts are not just a formality, they are a central element of
          the tenant’s legal and financial security. Requesting these documents
          and ensuring they include the tenant’s NIF is essential to guarantee
          tax benefits, legal protection, and a fair contractual relationship.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Proof of payment</h4>
        <p>
          Rent receipts serve as official proof that the tenant has fulfilled
          their obligation to pay the rent. In case of a dispute with the
          landlord (for example, claims of late or missed payments), the tenant
          can present these receipts as evidence, protecting themselves against
          unjustified actions.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Tax benefits</h4>
        <p>
          When rent receipts are issued with the tenant’s NIF (Tax
          Identification Number), the rent paid can be included as a deductible
          expense in the annual IRS (Personal Income Tax) declaration, allowing
          the tenant to benefit from tax deductions.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Legal validation of the contract</h4>
        <p>
          Properly issued receipts indicate that the rental contract is
          registered and declared to the Tax Authority. This contributes to a
          more transparent relationship between landlord and tenant, ensuring
          that both comply with their legal obligations. The absence of receipts
          may indicate informal arrangements or even tax irregularities on the
          landlord’s part.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Protection in case of legal conflicts</h4>
        <p>
          In any conflict resolution process, whether through judicial or
          extrajudicial means, rent receipts serve as valid proof. They can be
          used to verify dates, amounts paid, tenant identity, and payment
          regularity, being essential in situations such as contract
          terminations, evictions, or claims over wrongfully withheld security
          deposits, among other disputes.
        </p>
        <div style="height: 2rem"></div>
        <p>
          So, don’t hesitate! Always ask for the Rent Receipts, which must be
          provided to you by the landlord.
        </p>
        <p>
          These receipts are issued by the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority
          (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) and include: the landlord’s name
          and NIF; the tenant’s name and NIF; property identification; rent
          amount paid; date of rent payment; the rental period covered; rent
          receipt number; date of issue of the rent receipt; among other
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see an example of a rent receipt in the photo included in this
          article.
        </p>
        <div style="height: 2rem"></div>
        <p>
          In short, for the tenant, having and using the NIF in the rental
          contract is the way to be formally protected, secure tax rights, and
          ensure the contract’s validity under the law. This promotes greater
          security and trust in the landlord-tenant relationship, as well as a
          more transparent and balanced housing market.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t have your NIF yet, obtaining it should be one of your
          first steps upon arriving (or even before) in Portugal. The good news
          is that NIF4Erasmus handles everything for you, 100% online, with the
          simplest and most accessible process on the market. Moreover, the NIF
          application service already includes the request for your access
          password to the Portal das Finanças.
