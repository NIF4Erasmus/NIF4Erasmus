      <div class="privacy-section">
          <p>
            This Privacy and Data Protection Policy governs the matter of
            personal data and its protection in relation to the use of the
            website
            <a
              href="https://www.nif4erasmus.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >https://www.nif4erasmus.com/</a

            and its embedded forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Portuguese National Law on the Protection of Personal Data (Law
            no. 58/2019, of August 8) and the General Data Protection Regulation
            (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the
            Council of 27 April 2016, hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR” or
            “Regulation”) ensure the protection of natural persons with regard
            to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In legal terms, Personal Data refers to any information relating to
            an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”); an
            identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly
            or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
            name, an identification number, location data, online identifiers,
            or one or more specific elements of that natural person’s physical,
            physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social
            identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This document complies with the applicable legislation on Personal
            Data protection. However, it may be supplemented by additional
            procedures on Data Protection, as defined and made public by
            NIF4Erasmus.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Policy is intended to serve as guidance whenever questions
            arise concerning the processing of Personal Data in the various
            contexts in which users may be involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, this Policy is addressed to all those who wish to
            understand how NIF4Erasmus processes and protects the Personal Data
            of its Data Subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the data collection process, only the data strictly necessary
            to fulfill the informed purpose, or purposes closely related
            thereto, will be requested, always based on the lawful grounds
            explained to the Data Subject.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Controller Identification</h3>
          <p>
            The responsible for the processing of personal data is NIF4Erasmus,
            composed of lawyers registered with the Portuguese Bar Association.
            NIF4Erasmus provides services to students participating in exchange
            programs who are coming to Portugal to study, among other related
            activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            NIF4Erasmus seeks to apply best market practices regarding data
            protection and information security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, it aims to adopt the necessary and appropriate technical
            and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality,
            integrity, and availability of the Personal Data for which it is the
            Data Controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without prejudice to the above, the applicable legislation shall
            prevail over this Policy if it exceeds its standards, imposes
            stricter requirements, or ultimately provides a higher level of
            protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where this Policy offers a higher level of protection than
            the applicable law, or additional safeguards and rights for Data
            Subjects, this Policy shall take precedence.
          </p>
        
          <h3>2. Purposes of Personal Data Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Personal Data may only be processed for specific purposes, or other
            purposes closely related to them, that were communicated to the Data
            Subject at the time the data was originally collected. These
            purposes include:

            <p>Advertising and Marketing Purposes:</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            For objectives and purposes related to NIF4Erasmus own advertising
            and marketing activities, the following data may be retained:
            nationality, age, gender.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Limits</h3>
          <p>
            Under no circumstances will Personal Data concerning racial or
            ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
            beliefs, health or sexual life, or genetic or biometric data be
            directly requested, except when, at the time of such request, the
            Data Subject freely and expressly gives their informed consent.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Legal Basis</h3>
          <p>
            The legal basis for this processing of Personal Data is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            On the consent provided by the Data Subjects, for a variety of
            purposes, given freely, expressly, and substantiated through a clear
            and unambiguous affirmative act, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a)
            and Article 7 of the GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, if requested, we will strive to ensure that the process of
            withdrawing consent is as simple as the process of giving it, should
            the Data Subject wish to do so. Instructions on how to proceed can
            be found in this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where the Data Subject needs to provide Personal Data of
            third parties, they guarantee that they are legally authorized to do
            so, that they have informed the data subject about the processing of
            their data, and that they undertake to provide them with this
            Privacy Policy and any other applicable or future policies or terms
            related to the data and documents provided. In such cases, the Data
            Subject shall be solely responsible for complying with these
            obligations and with the applicable duty to inform.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Personal Data Retention Period</h3>
          <p>
            The retention period for personal data is that which is established
            by legal or regulatory provisions or, in their absence, the period
            necessary to fulfil the intended purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regard to personal data that NIF4Erasmus needs in order to
            demonstrate compliance with contractual or other obligations, such
            data may be retained until the applicable statute of limitations has
            expired.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            If necessary, NIF4Erasmus may engage companies and/or professionals
            to provide services such as cloud storage, email management, systems
            management and IT security, website development and maintenance,
            network security, health and safety, among others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, NIF4Erasmus may use payment systems (such as Stripe,
            for example, but not limited to), artificial intelligence tools,
            external forms, and similar solutions, which may be integrated both
            into its website and its own forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, NIF4Erasmus may share data with entities that have legal
            authority to process the data in question, when such sharing is
            legally applicable.
          </p>
          <p>7. Principles</p>
          <p>
            Users are hereby informed that NIF4Erasmus collects the documents
            and personal data necessary for the provision of its services,
            ensuring that such data is appropriate, relevant, and not excessive,
            and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for
            which it is processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure that the data remains valid, current, accurate, and up to
            date, we kindly ask users to notify us of any changes or
            modifications that may have occurred.

            In accordance with Article 8 of the GDPR and Article 16 of the
            Portuguese National Law on the Protection of Personal Data (Law no.
            58/2019, of 8 August), the personal data of minors may only be
            processed based on consent in relation to the direct offering of
            information society services if they are at least 13 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the minor is under the age of 13, the processing is only lawful
            if consent is given by their legal representatives.
          </p>
          <h3>10. Data Processing Security</h3>
          <p>
            Personal data is processed with the level of protection legally
            required to ensure its security and to prevent alteration, loss,
            unauthorized processing or access, taking into account the state of
            the art, the cost of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and
            purpose of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and
            severity of risks to the rights of natural persons.

            collected and processed in accordance with the applicable
            legislation, namely Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European
            Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (“GDPR”). This
            document complements and forms an integral part of the Privacy and
