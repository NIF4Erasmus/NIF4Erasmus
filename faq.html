          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal) is your taxpayer
              identification number in Portugal. It’s essential for many
              everyday tasks, like signing a rental contract, opening a bank
              account, getting a mobile phone plan, or signing up for health
              insurance. You may also hear it called the "Número de
              Contribuinte".

            <p>
              Usually, the process of obtaining your NIF takes between 3 to 5
              business days. This duration is subject to variation based on
              certain factors, primarily hinging on the operational efficiency
              of the Portuguese Tax Office.

            How can I register a NIF with a Portuguese address? 
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you are a citizen of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland you can register your NIF with a Portuguese address by providing a CRUE (Certificate of Registration of an EU Citizen - Certificado de Registo de Cidadão da União Europeia).  
            </p>
            <p>
              This certificate proves that you are legally residing in Portugal as an EU citizen and allows your NIF to be officially linked to a Portuguese address. Registering your NIF with a Portuguese address is important if you want to be recognized as a tax resident in Portugal.
              </p>
            <p> 
              Only EU citizens are eligible to use the CRUE for this purpose.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              A CRUE (Certificate of Registration of an EU Citizen - Certificado de Registo de Cidadão da União Europeia) is an official document that confirms your legal residence in Portugal. It is required to register your NIF with a Portuguese address and to be recognized as a tax resident in Portugal.

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You can obtain a CRUE at the local city hall (Câmara Municipal) in the municipality where you live in Portugal. Some municipalities may require an appointment, so it’s recommended to check their website or contact them directly before visiting.

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you are a citizen of a country outside the European Union, the European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland, you cannot use a CRUE. Instead, you must provide one of the following documents issued by AIMA (Agência para a Integração, Migrações e Asilo):   
           <ul class="documents-list">
                <li>
                  A valid residence permit, or 
                </li>
                <li>Proof of appointment with AIMA, or </li>
                <li>
                  A receipt or official document confirming that your residence permit application is pending 
                </li>
              </ul>
           
            <p> 
              These documents serve to prove your legal connection to Portugal and allow your NIF to be linked to a Portuguese address. Providing the correct documentation is essential for your NIF to reflect Portuguese tax residency, which may be important for financial, legal, and tax purposes.

              With your password you will be able to access the Portuguese tax office website, also known as Portal das Finanças, and through the portal, you can submit tax returns, issue and review electronic invoices, make payments, obtain certificates, update personal and business information, check fiscal status, and more, so you can manage your tax matters quickly and securely online.

              The password request service is included only for clients who purchase TAX REPRESENTATION service. For all other services, a password can be requested for an additional fee of €10 per request through NIF4Erasmus.

            <p> 
              Your password will be delivered to your address (EU/EEA Citizen, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, as well as citizens of Andorra and Switzerland) or fiscal representative (Non EU/EEA Citizen) by physical mail and usually takes about 3 - 4 weeks.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The NIF is issued by the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority

              Finanças.

            <p>
              The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal) is just a number, not a
              physical card. In Portugal, the physical NIF card no longer
              exists. Once your NIF is issued, you will receive it in digital

            <p>Yes, you need a NIF to rent a house in Portugal.</p>

              Rental contracts must be officially registered on the Portuguese

              parties involved - including the tenant - must have a valid NIF.
              It’s highly recommended to obtain your NIF before searching for
              accommodation, as most landlords will ask for it upfront.

              NIF is often necessary for basic tasks like signing a lease or

              If you have a permanent Portuguese address and are considered a

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you are a citizen of a country outside the European Union, the European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland, you cannot use a CRUE. Instead, you must provide one of the following documents issued by AIMA (Agência para a Integração, Migrações e Asilo):   
           <ul class="documents-list">
                <li>
                  A valid residence permit, or 
                </li>
                <li>Proof of appointment with AIMA, or </li>
                <li>
                  A receipt or official document confirming that your residence permit application is pending 
                </li>
              </ul>
           
            <p> 
              These documents serve to prove your legal connection to Portugal and allow your NIF to be linked to a Portuguese address. Providing the correct documentation is essential for your NIF to reflect Portuguese tax residency, which may be important for financial, legal, and tax purposes.
