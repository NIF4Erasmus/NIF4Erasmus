          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal) is your taxpayer
              identification number in Portugal. It’s essential for many
              everyday tasks, like signing a rental contract, opening a bank
              account, getting a mobile phone plan, or signing up for health
              insurance. You may also hear it called the "Número de
              Contribuinte".

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Usually, the process of obtaining your NIF takes between 3 to 5
              business days. This duration is subject to variation based on
              certain factors, primarily hinging on the operational efficiency
              of the Portuguese Tax Office.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              After NIF4Erasmus receives your NIF, we will automatically request
              your password from the Portuguese tax office. Your password will
              be delivered to your address (EU/EEA Citizen) or fiscal
              representative (Non EU/EEA Citizen) by physical mail and usually
              takes about 3 - 4 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we are your tax representative, once your password has been
              received, we will send you a copy via email. You will now be able
              to access the Portuguese tax office website, also known as Portal
              das Finanças. After you become a tax resident in Portugal, you
              will be able to update your address to your Portuguese address.

              The NIF is issued by the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal) is just a number, not a
              physical card. In Portugal, the physical NIF card no longer
              exists. Once your NIF is issued, you will receive it in digital

              Rental contracts must be officially registered on the Portuguese
              Tax Authority’s platform (Portal das Finanças), and for that, all
              parties involved - including the tenant - must have a valid NIF.
              It’s highly recommended to obtain your NIF before searching for
              accommodation, as most landlords will ask for it upfront.

              Yes. A NIF is mandatory to open a bank account in Portugal. Banks

              Even if you’re staying in Portugal for just a few months, having a
              NIF is often necessary for basic tasks like signing a lease or

              The tax representation is a legal service that allows
              non-residents in Portugal to have a representative in the country
              for tax purposes. This representative will handle all tax-related
              matters, such as filing taxes and communicating with the
              Portuguese tax authorities on your behalf.
