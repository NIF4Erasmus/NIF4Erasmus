        </p>
        <p>
          Any commercial or advertising use that is not expressly authorized is
          also prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>The user accepts the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To browse and use the website entirely and exclusively at their own
            risk, with NIF4Erasmus not being, under any circumstances,
            responsible for the user's use of the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            To refrain from engaging in any conduct while using the website or
            its available resources that violates or infringes upon the honor,
            personal or family privacy, or image of third parties, or that is
            unlawful or offensive to public morals; and to undertake, in all
            cases, to hold NIF4Erasmus harmless from any judicial or
            extrajudicial claims brought against it as a result of such misuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            To refrain from carrying out, by any means, any destruction,
            alteration, disabling, or damage to data, programs, or electronic
            documents that cause or may cause any kind of disruption to the
            network, system, or third-party equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            To hold NIF4Erasmus harmless from any liability for losses or
            damages caused in any way during the use and operation of the
            website and its forms, including, without limitation, damages
            resulting from suspension, interruption, malfunction and/or lack of
            access to the websites and services, as well as damages arising from
            the transmission of viruses or other harmful elements to the User.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Consequently, the user is required to maintain confidentiality
          regarding any private or confidential information in their possession,
          as well as any codes or passwords provided by third parties (official
          NIF4Erasmus partners) that grant the user access to benefits when
          acquiring any service potentially covered by such partnerships. The
          user shall also be held liable for any damages of any kind arising
          from misuse by themselves or by third parties, and shall be
          responsible for all resulting losses and damages. Any violation of
          these conditions may lead to legal action.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights</h3>
        <p>
          NIF4Erasmus declares that it respects the intellectual and industrial
          property rights of third parties. Therefore, if you believe that your
          intellectual and/or industrial property rights have been violated,
          please contact NIF4Erasmus at the following email address:
          info@nif4erasmus.com
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. Availability of External Links or Hyperlinks Not Affiliated with
          NIF4Erasmus
        </h3>
        <p>
          To facilitate access to potentially relevant resources, NIF4Erasmus
          provides hyperlinks on its website that lead to external websites not
          owned by NIF4Erasmus. Therefore, NIF4Erasmus cannot be held
          responsible for the content, functionality, or operation of the linked
          pages, nor for any potential damages that may result from accessing or
          using them.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Promotional Codes</h3>
        <p>
          Promotional codes offered by NIF4Erasmus are exclusive and intended
          for specific uses, as defined by the conditions in place at the time
          they are made available. They are non-transferable, non-redeemable for
          cash, and must be applied before completing the purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          NIF4Erasmus reserves the right to invalidate any promotional code in
          cases of misuse, fraud, or violation of these terms. Additionally,
          codes may be subject to expiration dates and usage limitations, as
          indicated in each promotional campaign. In case of doubts or issues
          related to the application of a code, the customer must contact
          NIF4Erasmus support before completing the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading these terms does not exempt users from consulting the specific
          conditions established by our official partners, whenever promotional
          codes are made available through such partnerships. Using a
          promotional code implies full acceptance of these terms.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          A refund of any amount paid to NIF4Erasmus will be available if the
          cancellation of the service is requested before the service has begun
          processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the service has started, refunds will no longer be available,
          except in cases where the service cannot be completed due to obstacles
          attributable to administrative entities, namely due to errors, lack of
          documentation, or missing information that prevent the regular
          progress of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          For services contracted exclusively through digital means and paid via
          electronic payment platforms (such as Stripe, among others),
          NIF4Erasmus reserves the right to refund only the net amount received,
          excluding any fees or commissions charged by those platforms for
          processing the payment.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Use of Frames</h3>
        <p>
          NIF4Erasmus expressly prohibits the use of “framing” or any other
          mechanisms by third parties that alter the design, original layout, or
          content of its website and forms.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Security</h3>
        <p>
          NIF4Erasmus has adopted appropriate technical and organizational
          measures to safeguard the security of the services provided through
          its website, to ensure the integrity of electronic traffic data
          related to unauthorized access or knowledge, and to prevent the risk
          of dissemination, destruction, or loss of both confidential and
          non-confidential user data and information contained on the website or
          related to access — whether unauthorized or in violation of applicable
          legal provisions — to such personal data and information.
        </p>
        <p>
          All information, data, and documents are protected by professional
          secrecy, in accordance with Article 92 of the Statute of the
          Portuguese Bar Association (Law no. 145/2015, of 9 September).
        </p>
        <h3>8. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          The user undertakes to use the website’s services responsibly and is
          accountable for their proper use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any user who acts against the image, good name, or reputation of
          NIF4Erasmus, as well as anyone who unlawfully or fraudulently uses the
          images, logos, or content of the website and its forms, and/or in any
          way infringes upon the intellectual or industrial property rights over
          the content and services, shall be held liable.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Lack of availability, continuity, access, maintenance, and operation

          </li>
          <li>
            The transmission and/or presence of virus, other harmful elements or

            respective electronic documents or files;
          </li>
          <li>
            The unlawful, negligent, or fraudulent use that impersonates third
            parties or is contrary to the content of these Terms and Conditions,
            good faith, or the commercial best practices of the Website, its
            services, and content;
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal violations and customary practices committed by third parties
            regarding intellectual property rights, industrial property, trade
            secrets or contractual secrets, privacy rights, personal data
            protection, honor, image, property, advertising, or competition,
            among others;
          </li>
          <li>
            Defects or faults in the content and/or services accessed through
            the Website;
          </li>
          <li>
            The receipt, obtaining, dissemination, storage, or transmission by

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
